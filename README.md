# Browser Support

Check your project's browser requirements. When working on cutting-edge tech stack, it is important to figure out the oldest supported browsers. We can use [caniuse.com](https://www.caniuse.com/), though it doesn't check browser support for multiple features.

This is where `browser-support` comes in. Visit [browser-support](https://zhirzh.github.io/browser-support/build/) to calculate the bottom line for your code's browser support.
